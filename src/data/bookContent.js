            "Symptoms is a 70,000-word literary coming-of-age novel that follows Kevin, a once vibrant and expressive boy, whose voice fades into silence after a traumatic childhood beating silences not just his body but his spirit.",
            "Set in rural and peri-urban Kenya, the novel delves into the psychological aftermath of unspoken trauma, familial betrayal, and the fragile hope of a child who still clings to promises long broken. Kevin’s journey begins with innocence and inspiration—watching Bruce Lee films and admiring his charismatic older brother—but veers into isolation after a violent punishment sends him spiraling into fear and self-censorship.",
            "Transferred to a rural school, Kevin battles confusion, disillusionment, and a desperate yearning for his father's approval. When a familiar but corrupted face from his past—a troubled peer named Seda—joins his class, Kevin is drawn toward rebellion, addiction, and self-doubt. Yet, his fear remains greater than his rage, and so he begins a slow transformation: not into the hero he once imagined, but into"

Raised in a blended family marked by silence and unspoken pain, Kevin finds solace in the presence of his older brother Otis, whose mentorship sparks a version of life he never imagined.",
            "Just as hope begins to take root, Kevin is suddenly pulled out of the light and sent back to a place he had outgrown—a rural day school far from the dreams Otis had helped him glimpse. What follows is a slow unraveling of trust, identity, and belief in the people around him.",
            "Through school scandals, quiet rebellions, and silent grief, Kevin becomes more withdrawn, his actions misunderstood by teachers, peers, and even himself. But what people see—his silence, the mischief, the drugs, the detachment—are not the story. They are the symptoms of something deeper, things that cannot always be spoken out loud."

Their mother had died when Kevin was just two. No one spoke about her anymore, but the void she left would become more visible as Kevin grew, trying to find his own identity in a household where everyone already had theirs carved out.

There was no hallway to slip back into, nowhere to hide.",

Her voice ruled the home—loud, impatient, sometimes kind but often biting. Kevin learned early how to dodge her temper. She ran a salon, their father had helped set up. The second sister had a different weight on her shoulders. She had gotten pregnant in high school, and though she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, something in her dimmed after that. Their father bought her a sewing machine to help her rebuild her life and sponsored his eldest brother, Marcus,  to a driving school. ",

Everyone looked out for him in their own flawed ways, but no one really saw him—not fully. So, Kevin absorbed his world in fragments. He picked up arrogance from his eldest sister,  quiet detachment from the second, unpredictability from his father, street and book smarts from his brothers, and gentle playfulness from Joy.",

The school was a melting pot—a place where students from different estates, languages, and temperaments converged. Kevin liked it there. He wasn’t at the top of his class, but he did well. His teachers noticed his curiosity, his odd questions, and his habit of trailing off into thought even in the middle of a sentence. He stayed with Brian only one year in the school as Brian's year of graduation was his first. Brian went to High school and he saw him less often since then, only occasionally at home."

He could remember the taste of ice cream, Sunday school, the Karate hall, the feeling of walking into a store without being followed by suspicious eyes, the rare moments of laughter with Joy in the city, and the childhood games. The good memories warmed him — but also hurt, because they reminded him of what he’d lost. And the bad ones — the rejections, the disappointment, the sting of being unloved — started hardening him. He didn’t know it, but he was slowly withdrawing from the world. The once-curious, animated boy was becoming quiet, observant, bitter. He began to talk less, smile less.

He wandered aimlessly until he could find someone ploughing, so he would offer to help. Some paid him; some didn’t.

He was also tough — his eyes carried something Kevin recognized but couldn’t explain: something like pain, cloaked in charisma. There were whispers that he smoked marijuana, and some boys joked that it was the source of his sharp wit and fearless energy. But no one could deny — he was brilliant in drama. He could become anything on stage — a prophet, a criminal, a madman. He made people laugh and think and wonder. He had what Kevin secretly craved: presence."

Kevin’s eyes stung each time he thought of how easily his own education had been discarded. Why didn’t anyone fight for him? Why had Joy and he been so forgotten? It was a pain that had no answer.",

She exploded, threatening to leave, and take the baby with her. Kevin panicked. He begged. He swore he’d quit. And for a while, he cleaned up again.",

To work collaboratively with her in her role in the NGO she worked for but he was too blind to see the opportunity. His mind was mostly preoccupied with the turns his life was taking.",

            "He visited a nearby university, trembling as he walked past the gates. At 28, he was older than most of the students. He felt out of place, like a ghost in a world that had moved on without him. This was his first time steppin into a university all his life and obviously the first time he was realizing the value of such institutions. He pushed himself and got the fee structure. Then headed to the next university and got the second. Both were painful to look at. There was no way he could afford it—not with a child, a wife, and a mountain of bills. He realized how much he had procrastinated. This was twelve years after his graduation from High school. University should have been his next stop. He couldn’t blame himself, he had been alone all those years.",
