            "Symptoms is a 70,000-word literary coming-of-age novel that follows Kevin, a once vibrant and expressive boy, whose voice fades into silence after a traumatic childhood beating silences not just his body but his spirit.",
            "Set in rural and peri-urban Kenya, the novel delves into the psychological aftermath of unspoken trauma, familial betrayal, and the fragile hope of a child who still clings to promises long broken. Kevin’s journey begins with innocence and inspiration—watching Bruce Lee films and admiring his charismatic older brother—but veers into isolation after a violent punishment sends him spiraling into fear and self-censorship.",
            "Transferred to a rural school, Kevin battles confusion, disillusionment, and a desperate yearning for his father's approval. When a familiar but corrupted face from his past—a troubled peer named Seda—joins his class, Kevin is drawn toward rebellion, addiction, and self-doubt. Yet, his fear remains greater than his rage, and so he begins a slow transformation: not into the hero he once imagined, but into"

It will resonate with audiences who understand that silence is sometimes a shield—and other times, a prison."

Raised in a blended family marked by silence and unspoken pain, Kevin finds solace in the presence of his older brother Otis, whose mentorship sparks a version of life he never imagined.",
            "Just as hope begins to take root, Kevin is suddenly pulled out of the light and sent back to a place he had outgrown—a rural day school far from the dreams Otis had helped him glimpse. What follows is a slow unraveling of trust, identity, and belief in the people around him.",
            "Through school scandals, quiet rebellions, and silent grief, Kevin becomes more withdrawn, his actions misunderstood by teachers, peers, and even himself. But what people see—his silence, the mischief, the drugs, the detachment—are not the story. They are the symptoms of something deeper, things that cannot always be spoken out loud.",

Symptoms doesn’t just tell his story—it diagnoses the subtle, everyday pains that so many carry in silence.",

Pain can range from mild discomfort to severe agony and may be sharp, dull, burning, aching, stabbing, or throbbing in character.",
            "The experience of pain is highly subjective and influenced by multiple factors, including one's pain threshold, past experiences, cultural background, and emotional state. This makes the assessment of pain particularly challenging in clinical settings.",

This type of pain can be more difficult to treat and may require specialized medications. Conditions like diabetic neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia cause neuropathic pain.",

Visual analog scales and face scales are alternatives that may be easier for some patients to use.",

When constipation develops suddenly in someone with previously regular habits, it warrants evaluation, especially if accompanied by abdominal pain or unexplained weight loss.",

Neuroimaging may be indicated when headaches have atypical features or when they're accompanied by neurological symptoms, seizures, or signs of increased intracranial pressure."
